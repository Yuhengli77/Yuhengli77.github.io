This project explores the improvement of text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on the problem of language binding in stable diffusion models. Text-to-image generation usually suffers from attribute misbinding,  omissions, and semantic leakage, which can lead to inaccurate visual representations between textual prompts and generated images. Based on the SynGen method, our team proposes a new loss function by introducing an extra entropy term. During the denoising process, this entropy term aims to refine the attention graph to make the relationship between modifiers and their corresponding entities more accurate. This method achieves an improvement in the correspondence of attributes in the generated image compared to the Syngen method.
